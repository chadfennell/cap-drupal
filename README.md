This cap script was inspired by the one listed here (contains a discussion of "why use capistrano"): 

http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/capistrano-drupal-deployments-made-easy-part-1

"cap-drupal" is an example deployment script that demonstrates a very simple single site capistrano deployment script that uses Drush Make.

Installation: 

1. Install the gems.

gem install capistrano
gem install capistrano-ext
gem install railsless-deploy

2. Create and Configure the environments.

2.1 Download/clone cap-drupal.

git clone git://github.com/chadfennell/cap-drupal.git

2.2 Download/clone cap-drupal-example at the same directory level as cap-drupal.

├── cap-drupal
└── cap-drupal-example

git clone git://github.com/chadfennell/cap-drupal-example.git

├── capfile -> ../cap-drupal/capfile
└── config
    ├── deploy
    │   ├── development.rb
    │   ├── production.rb
    │   └── staging.rb
    └── deploy.rb -> ../../cap-drupal/config/deploy.rb


2.3 Edit the development.rb, staging.rb, and production.rb to reflect your server setup.

└── cap-drupal-example
    └── config
        ├── deploy
        │   ├── development.rb <- Edit Me
        │   ├── production.rb <- Edit Me
        │   └── staging.rb <- Edit Me

3. Create the app directory (the parent direcotry that holds your drupal code, file assets, configuration and other directories).

3.1 e.g. "/var/www/your.app/"

4. Run the Capistrano setup task.

4.1 e.g. "cap staging deploy:setup"

5 Set up the "releases" directory.

5.1 Set an SGID on your app "releases" directory so all users of a given group may edit all deployed files by default, regardless of which user made a particular deployment.

5.2 For more info on SGID see http://www.library.yale.edu/wsg/docs/permissions/sgid.htm

5.3 e.g. "chmod g+rws /var/www/your.app/"

6 Set up the "shared" directory.

6.1 Configure your Drupal default directory and settings.ph file in the generated "shared" directory.

6.2 Create your settings.php and place it in the /path/to/your.app/shared/default directory.
 
6.3 Create the files directory.

6.3.1 cap-drupal defaults to a file directory located under "/path/to/your.app/shared/default/files".

6.3.1.1 You may choose to locate this directory elsewhere and linking to it within the ":symlink" task in your deployment scripts.

7. Point your apache configuration to the "current" directory under your application root. e.g: 

DocumentRoot /var/www/your.app/current"
<Directory "/var/www/your.app/current">

8. Run your deploy command (e.g. "cap staging deploy").
